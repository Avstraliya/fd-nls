For years, I was using LapLink to transfer files between my various 'retro' computers. It works, yes, but it's also annoyingly slow and requires constant attention. One day I thought, 'Wouldn't it be amazing if all my DOS PCs could share a common network drive, similarly to how NFS operates in the *nix world?'. This day EtherDFS was born. I clearly didn't invent anything - the concept has been around almost as long as the first IBM PC, and several commercial products addressed that need in the past. I am not aware, however, of any free and open-source solution. Besides, all the commercial solutions I know require to set up a pretty complex network environment first, while EtherDFS doesn't need anything more than just a packet driver.",etherdfs,DOS,MIT License,051deb3d0ed49f3223af6cc883149219dbde1e6152d00460a0e6aede14e5c364

No need for any network configuration - the DOS PC only needs to have some kind of Ethernet adapter (physical or emulated, for example through PLIP) and a suitable packet driver. The Linux server and the DOS PC must be connected to a common Ethernet segment (same LAN).","network, floppy, emulator, asm",DOS,ISC license,743ed1d85d17efef41229b46a8a8308fe8cd8e80bc70d23868b06215fb38615d

yapcbr,Yet Another PC Bridge,layer 2 bridge for packet drivers (turns a PC into a switch),"This bridge belongs to the class of Self Learning Transparent bridges. You can use any Ethernet cards (or a mix of cards from different vendors) for this bridge. All you need to have is the appropriate packet drivers for these cards. Packet drivers for most of the ethernet cards are in public domain and can be obtained from crynwr.com. This bridge can be set up using a PC or AT (hard disk is not necessary, a floppy drive is sufficient) running MSDOS ver 3.0 or higher. This is not a spanning tree bridge and hence cannot detect loops in network paths.",bridge,dos,"GNU General Public License, Version 1",cbe11727c3edc9251dccb52e09dd170f5a8d3079d93ce5f94d1fe7a2e2dfc005

zdir,ZDir,ZanySoft Directory Lister,"ZDir is a tiny DOS directory lister that I started years ago when I was in high school. Compared to the dozens of other directory listers of the day, it was the best-- ZDir automatically determined how many columns to display, it could display a full tree, the colors were completely configurable, it worked in any text mode, no matter how non-standard, and it was lightning fast (written in assembly language). ZDir was available as shareware, and was quite popular, though it's not very useful any more because it does not support long filenames.","asm, assembler, assembly, a86, dir",DOS,"GNU General Public License, v3",1886bdc79de96a95ab19669a88ac2e3bc401a24e8a35c10edbdfa291ec787154
