etherdfs,ETHERDFS,Ethernet DOS file system (maps a remote drive over raw Ethernet),"EtherDFS is an 'installable filesystem' TSR for DOS. It maps a drive from a remote computer (typically Linux-based) to a local drive letter, using raw ethernet frames to communicate. For years, I was using LapLink to transfer files between my various 'retro' computers. It works, yes, but it's also annoyingly slow and requires constant attention. One day I thought, 'Wouldn't it be amazing if all my DOS PCs could share a common network drive, similarly to how NFS operates in the *nix world?'. This day EtherDFS was born. I clearly didn't invent anything - the concept has been around almost as long as the first IBM PC, and several commercial products addressed that need in the past. I am not aware, however, of any free and open-source solution. Besides, all the commercial solutions I know require to set up a pretty complex network environment first, while EtherDFS doesn't need anything more than just a packet driver.",etherdfs,,DOS,MIT License,11f9ff54f49b9819ac86f615475cdc5320659e1b4c7a4605ce04384f9de941ac

No need for any network configuration - the DOS PC only needs to have some kind of Ethernet adapter (physical or emulated, for example through PLIP) and a suitable packet driver. The Linux server and the DOS PC must be connected to a common Ethernet segment (same LAN).","network, floppy, emulator, asm",,DOS,ISC license,743ed1d85d17efef41229b46a8a8308fe8cd8e80bc70d23868b06215fb38615d

orangec,Orange C,The Orange Toolchain is designed for DOS/WIN32.

The compiler itself uses various standard techniques, as well as some interesting techniques mentioned in literature. This compiler has support for the various C standards through C11, and full support for C++ 14. The IDE for the compiler is a full featured C/C++ language IDE including a colorizing editor with code completion, integrated make facility, debugger, and a WIN32 resource editor. The tool chain is highly generic and the possibility exists to customize it for embedded platforms (or for that matter for example for other operating systems) using various linker customization files along with backend code generation programs. The existing backend code generation programs support WIN32 and MSDOS executable formats, along with a backend generator that will output Intel and Motorola hex files. The assembler uses a simple architecture description language to customize the code generation. The C Run time library this compiler uses is an enhancement of the RTL used by CC386. The Run time library in this package has WIN32 headers and an import library, many windows programs will compile with it although there are a few incompatibilities.","develop, c",,DOS,"GNU General Public License, Version 3",5cc51a34e3d9665803fbd2bed3494d4b1bc780bfcf2fcfee0aa029a02d8c3e30
