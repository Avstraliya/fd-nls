# FreeDOS Package Index List

These are multi-language listings for FreeDOS packages. They are used by
software like FDIMPLES to provide native language descriptions for packages
supplied on the FreeDOS release media and other locations.

The latest ENGLISH version is created and maintained automatically by the
Official FreeDOS Software Repository online at:

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/repositories/latest/listing.csv

If you wish to provide an new language translation, or updates to an existing
translation, you should use (or at least review) the latest English version to
include any new software packages. Simply translate the Description, Summary
and Keyword fields. Other fields, like TITLE do not get or use multi-language
translations.
